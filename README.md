# 🌧️ Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Precipitation and Its Extremities in Nepal (1995–2024)

This project analyzes Nepal’s precipitation trends and extremes from 1995 to 2024 using CHIRPS rainfall data at a spatial resolution of 5 km. It explores seasonal and annual patterns, visualizes spatial distributions, and applies statistical methods to detect significant trends in precipitation.


## Objective

To assess the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation and its extremities over Nepal from 1995 to 2024 using satellite-derived CHIRPS rainfall data.
